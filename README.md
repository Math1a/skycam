# Camera Matlab use:

Using a DSLR camera or an astronomical camera is pretty similar, they both use the same class, properties and methods.

**Skycam is written as a class in Matlab, first, we will need to create a Skycam object (in this case, P):**
```matlab
P = Skycam
```
*Next, we can assign the properties that we would like to change:*

**The camera type, this is crucial in order for the camera to work properly (default DSLR):**
```matlab
P.CameraType = 'DSLR' / 'ASTRO'
```
- Note that while only two values are possible, many inputs will be valid.
For example; 'Nikon', 'Canon' and 'dslr' are valid inputs that will result in the CameraType to be 'DSLR'.
- This is the same for astronomical cameras; 'QHY', 'QHY367', 'QHYCCD' 'astro' and some more inputs are valid and will result in the CameraType being 'ASTRO'.

Exposure time, in seconds (default 8):
```matlab
P.ExpTime = x
```

Time delay between each capture, in seconds from the start of the previous capture (default 12):
```matlab
P.Delay = x
```

Image path (default '/home/ocs/skycam/'), only relevant while the camera type is DSLR:
```matlab
P.ImagePath = 'x'
```
**Initiate the connection with the camera, make sure it is connected via USB and turned on:**
```matlab
P.connect
```
- This method will also search if an Arduino temperature sensor is connected.

**To start capturing images, use the 'start' function**
```matlab
P.start
```

- Note that properties cannot be changed while the camera is started and capturing images.

For DSLR cameras:
- A bash script will run, organizing all the images in the image path directory.
- A plot window will open with a live view of the camera, and the camera will continue capturing until it will be disconnected.
- If astropack is present, the images will be saved with (AstroPack's) 'ImagePath''s standard, else, it will be saved just in 'P.ImagePath'.

For Astronimical cameras:
- A timer object is created that will call the private property "takeExposure" every {Delay} seconds.
- Currently the display is turned off for technical reasons, but it can be turned on for liveview (with ClassCommand).

**Stopping the image capture:**
```matlab
P.stop
```

- Stopping the image capture is preferable if you intend to use the same camera later and not turn it off in the meantime.
- If you turn off the camera, you should first disconnect it.
- Reconnecting the same camera with 'connect' instantly after 'disconnect' may cause some errors in DSLR cameras.

**Correctly shutting down is crucial!** Otherwise, it can leave the timer/bash script running in the background and cause errors.

*Do not clear or delete the class before disconnecting.*

**Disconnection:**
```matlab
P.disconnect
```
Disconnection will take a few seconds, it will close the liveview window and clear the class' objects.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ExpTime | The exposure time of the camera, note that this might be rounded to the closest available value, as not all values are possible. | 8 | Yes |
| Delay | Time delay in seconds between the start of each capture. | 12 | Yes |
| CameraType | The type of camera used. Can only be "DSLR" or "ASTRO", multiple inputs are supported, but they will return only one of these two values. | "DSLR" | Yes |
| ImagePath | The parent directory where the images will be saved. | '/home/ocs/skycam/' | Yes |
| Temperature | Debug property, shows the temperature of the sensor, if connected. | ~ | Only if found |
| CameraTemp | ASTRO - Only: The internal temperature of the camera. | Readonly | Only in ASTRO mode |
| CameraRes | The camera serial resource, is used for both astronomical as DSLR cameras, but it will store different resources. | Readonly | Yes |
| SensorType | Debug property, the type of temperature logger that is found and connected (Arduino / Digitemp). | Readonly | No |
| TemperatureLogger | The temperature logger serial resource, if found. Serial resource for arduino and bash script process for Digitemp. | Readonly | No |
| DataDir | AstroPack: The child directory where the images will be saved, a subdirectory of ImagePath. | Readonly | No |
| FileCheck | In DSLR mode: The file organizing script process. <br /> In ASTRO mode: The timer object that calls TakeExposure. | Readonly | No |
| ExpTimesData | DSLR - Only: The data table of the possible exposure times that is read from the camera's settings. | Readonly | No | 
| InitialTemp | Debug property, the initial temperature of the sensor (if found). Used for comparison and to avoid overheating. | Readonly | No |
| Found | Debug property, indicates if a temperature logger was found. | 0 (false) | No |

<details><summary> Debug methods </summary>

| Method name | Summary | Properties | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| connectSensor | Used to connect the Arduino or Digitemp_DS9097 temperature sensors with serialport (Arduino) or bash (Digitemp), automatically detects port unless provided. This method is called by the 'connect' method automatically and detects if there is a sensor connected | Port, Baud - The serial port and baud rate of the Arduino |
| imageTimer | Detects when a new file has been saved on disk. Blocks Matlab, and can only be interrupted with Ctrl + C | |
| logTemperature | Uses Digitemp_DS9097 USB temperature sensor to log temperatures (instead of arduino) every 2 seconds (can be changed). Creates a file in the ImagePath directory where it saves a timetable with the temperature data. | |

<summary> Get the sun's altitude (Currently unimplemented) </summary>
<br>

The sun's altitude can be used to determine when to take images (only at night), it is not currently being used in the Skycam class, but it might be useful.

We use AstroPack's "celestial" in order to determine where the sun is (in order to determine whether it is time to start taking images).
Basic sun altitude reading:
```matlab
% Get sun parameters
sun = celestial.SolarSys.get_sun;
% Extract altitude
sunalt = sun.Alt
% If we want to convert to degrees:
sunalt = rad2deg(sun.Alt);
```
